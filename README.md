# WinKart WIP
## How to build
You need to have python, msvc and visual studio installed.<br />
FIXME: You need to copy the contents of asset folder into build folder<br />
Run `python generate_build.py`.<br />
You might need to open `generate_build.py` and set the correct `vcvarsall.bat` location.<br />
You might need to place `devenv.exe` (the one that launches visual studio) into PATH for the debugger to open automatically.<br />
## Conventions
TODO:
## Before releases
inspect `// TEMPORARY:` sections and `DEBUG` def blocks
